An app I've been working on for some number of years now, initially as an excuse to learn Android application development and make something that could be considered a 'full stack' application. After many things pulling me away (my master's thesis and this website to name a few) and after having written and rewritten the codebase many times, it's finally nearing completion. The images in the thumbnail are from a much earlier version.
