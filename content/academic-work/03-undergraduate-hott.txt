At university I took an 'Individual Study' course. I don't remember what the original agreed-upon scope of the study was but I ended up studying Homotopy Type Theory, the Equivalence Principle, Univalent Foundations, Set Theory vs. Type Theory, and finally some Category Theory. One 16,000-word draft later, I had to take a leave absence for health reasons - spurred on by a global pandemic. This here is my attempt at repurposing that draft into something useful for future undergrads lest my efforts go to waste.
