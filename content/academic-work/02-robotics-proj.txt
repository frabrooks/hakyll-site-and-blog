One of the highlights of my Computer Science degree. This was a group project in which we implemented <a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_navigation">robot localisation</a> via <a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_localization">particle filtering</a> in C++. For the final part of the project we basically had to do something wacky with the robot and we made a robot 'waiter' that could deliver drinks ordered via an android app once it had figured out where it was in the lower ground floor of the computer science building.
